# Vinyl Viewer

This is a simple api for storing, adding and retrieving a list of vinyl I own at home or want to buy in the near future. 

This service runs on heroku using the mongoLab add on.

This was created with the help of Jean Weatherwax's great class on Skill Share https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Build-an-API-with-Node-Express-and-MongoDB

## The future
I'm building this with the idea of making a pretty website to display my abums, then tie in another music api to get more info about the albums. Then I can enjoy an enhanced listening and learning experience. I also want to use it to include albums I want to own but don't.


this is great!
